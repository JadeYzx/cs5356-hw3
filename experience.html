        <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>For the back-end experience, I’ve taken CS1110 and CS2110 at Cornell and received A in both courses. During
            the
            courses, I learned from multiple assignments using many algorithms such as recursion, DFS, BFS, GUI, and
            concurrency. Following the instructions from the professor, my partner and I successfully rebuilt the
            classic
            game, Alien Invaders. We also got a grade of 97.9 out of 100 when completing the final assignment of CS2110,
            which requires us to find the shortest path as well as the highest score. For the front-end experience, I
            took
            Intro to Digital Product Design last semester and gained plenty of experience in designing websites and apps
            through the full process of people’s problem, brainstorm, user research, and prototyping. In the end, I
            redesigned Instagram and added a trending feature using Figma. Moreover, I’m studying front-end web
            development
            on my own last summer and I'm taking INFO1300 Introductory Design and Programming for the Web this semester.

        <h2>Research Experience</h2>
        <p>For research experience, I did research on green finance, eco-investing, as well as its future trend and gave
            a
            speech on COP24 in 2018. Also, I joined an Academic Research Program during high school and wrote a final
            report
            analyzing the entrepreneurship and business operation of a famous beverage chain under the help of Professor
            Nguyen at Brown University. Moreover, I participated in the High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling as
            the
            team leader and won the honorable mention award. I also learned very much from helping with the data
            research
            programs when I interned at Urban XYZ in Beijing. Now, I'm working with Professor Belot and Professor
            Kircher on
            algorithms of job search platforms. </p>
